1. Section Scheduler’s Viewpoint:

It is the first day of the 56-day crew schedule cycle, and the Crew Scheduler autogenerated the scheduler. The C2 Section Scheduler, Lt. Nico DiAngelo, reviews the schedule to ensure that there are no conflicts.
- Things to demonstrate
  1. generation of panama schedule to autofill the crews
  2. creation of a conflict that impacts the autogenerated schedule
  3. notification alert of a conflict
  4. re-run the autogeneration to remove the conflict
  5. notification to newly added crew member that they will fill the new schedule

He just received a notification that a conflict exists within the schedule. Looking into the notification, he discovers that Capt. Annabeth Chase, a MCC for Blue Crew, has just received last minute TDY orders to participate in the Arachne Exercise at Beale AFB from 1Feb to 13Feb. Going over the list of available crew members, Lt. DiAngelo finds another member of the Brew Crew with the same qualifications and certifications associated with the MCC position, Capt. Percy Jackson. Lt. DiAngelo manually adjusts the crew schedule to include Capt. Jackson, covering for Capt. Chase for the duration of her TDY.

2. Individual Crew Member’s Viewpoint:
- Things to demonstrate
  1. view their individual schedule for the 56-day period
  2. receive notification of any changes to their schedule

TSgt. Tyson Cyclopes has just signed into the Crew Scheduler to review his schedule for the next 56 days. He noticed that he is scheduled to work D-TT on 17Jan to 19Jan; however, TriCare has just scheduled him to have LASIK eye surgery on the 16th with an expected 3-day recovery period. He submits a Conflict through the Crew Scheduler.

Lt. DiAngelo, as the C2 Section Scheduler, receives a notification via email that there is a Conflict to the schedule. He logs into the Crew Scheduler to review the Conflict. He sees TSgt. Cyclopes’ conflict and begins reviewing the list of available crew members to fill in TSgt. Cyclopes’ position. Unfortunately, there are no other crew member that can fill in TSgt. Cyclopes’ position within the C2 Blue Crew and maintain the required minimum crew manning; however, Lt. DiAngelo does find available personnel on the C2 Green Crew, SSgt. Rachel Dare, who can cover the position. He manually adjusts the crew schedule to have SSgt. Dare cover TSgt. Cyclopes’ position.

SSgt. Dare receives an email notification that there has been a recent change in her schedule. She logs into the Crew Scheduler to read the notification that she will be D-TT from the 17th to the 19th for the C2 Blue Crew.

3. SrA Clarisse La Rue is a member of the WADS Mafia MMA Club and has been selected to represent the Air Force in the Total Force recruiting effort with the Professional Fighters League (PFL). The PFL has six regular seasons, and SrA La Rue has been asked to appear for the First Regular Season for the Women’s Lightweight fights in Long Island, NY on May 9th. SrA La Rue checks the Crew Scheduler but notices that the Scheduler does not project out to May yet; however, she submits a leave request for May 8th to the 10th with a comment explaining why she is requesting the leave through the Crew Scheduler.
